# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)
We used the system call fork() to download and upload files in parallel. 

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)
We found the main buffer overrun bugs in the places that used the function 
call strcpy. In the function start_download, we checked to see that the length 
of the file name does not exceed the maximum file name size in order to check 
for a possible buffer overflow. Likewise, we checked the length of the file 
name in the function task_upload. 

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)
We increased the maximum task buffer size (TASKBUFSIZ) so that when the 
popular tracker is used (from executing make run-popular), larger aliases will 
be able to be accomodated. Increasing it by a factor of 8 allowed us to 
download files from the popular tracker. 

We also checked for the permissions of the files that the user requests. We 
did so by checking that the files requested are indeed in the current 
directory (since those in other directories cannot be served). We especially 
verified that files whose names begin with a slash are not served. 

We ensured that malicious users do not stream large quantities of data by 
setting a maximum file size. We set it to 2 megabytes. 

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)
We implemented an uploader attack. When the user request a file, we instead do 
one of two things, depending on what file the user wants. If the user wants 
a file whose name contains cat, we open /dev/urandom. If the the user specifies 
 any other file, we open /dev/zero. These attacks will be successful if the 
file permission is not checked. They can possibly cause the disk to run out of 
space to write data. 

We also implemented a downloader attack. When the user requests to download a 
file, we instead ask to download a file with a very long name. If the code is 
not written robustly, then there will be a buffer overflow, resulting in a 
segmentation fault. 

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: File Integrity (MD5 checksum)
Please examine the code implemented in the function task_download for details. 

# Add any other information you'd like us to know below this line.
To run downloads/uploads with the MD5 checksum, set the defined variable MD5SUM
 to 1, at the top of osppeer.c.
